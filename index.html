                    <h3>Hometown, Homebase, Homefree</h3>
                    <p>
                        Born and raised in New Jersey, in what I call the backyard of New York City, I am what is
                        referred
                        to as a "bridge and tunnel kid". Does this bring me any sense of purpose? Not really, but it
                        does
                        give me a sense of my identity. On the weekends I would take the train and sleep on my
                        cousin's
                        couch, getting into trouble and hanging out on rooftops. Now I don't have the same feeling
                        of
                        excitement for NYC I used to have and moved to Los Angeles three years ago.
                    <div class="places-lived">
                        <ol> Places I have lived:
                            <li>Warren, NJ</li>
                            <li>Columbus, Ohio</li>
                            <li>Berlin, Germany</li>

                    <p>
                        One thing remained the same no matter where I have lived, I have always found community
                        through
                        my
                        work as a dancer and choreographer. It doesn't always pay the bills, but it has brought me
                        friendship, connection to many cities worldwide, giving me purpose, identity, and creative
                        freedom.
                        Now I am exploring a new form of work as a software engineer and look forward to meshing my
                        ongoing
                        passion for dance with a newfound love in coding.

                        So far some of the work I have devised combines dance and tech. The pieces have been
                        performed
                        in
                        NYC, Brooklyn, Columbus, Ohio, Los Angeles, Berlin, Germany, and Tallinn, Estonia.
